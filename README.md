### Dashboards
* scatter
* heat map
* correlation
* time series
* tree map
* parallel categories (hidden)
* radar

### Analyses
* PCA decomposition

## To Do
### App
* shared filtering section (but really filters, i.e. generalisation of the current filter on years) but independent display options between tabs.
* Document all (used) columns of the dataframe in the offcanvas help section ("h√§?" button)
### Dashboards
* Scatterplot
  * Modify hovertemplate to show less digits
  * Add toggle to turn labels on and off? (currently hardcoded depending on group by chosen)
* Heatmap
  * Remove timestamp as an option for x and y axis
* Correlation
  * Show numbers in matrix heatmap (need to updgrade to higher version of dash once available, see comments in code for more detail).
* Time-series
  * Add the possibility to show a single year within the same plot (highlighted).
  * Move filters next to charts (filter upper and lower chart independently)?
  * Rename filters ("x axis" and "y axis" don't make sense)
  * Remove timestamp as an option.
  * Why just two measures shown, why not all at once? (i.e. all six Bewertungskriterien in plots). Could get too busy, though.
* Treemap
  * Choice whether to include skits or not (currently not). Would mess up the colors, though, as skits are not rated by the OPNRCDKMT (or require clever nested callbacks to hide the color option when skits are included)
* Radar
  * Make values shown in Radar Nr 1 and 2 dropdowns dynamic, i.e. depending on filters and a preceding dropdown where a column can be chosen.

## Bugs
* Scatter
  * Color by Jahr has decimal rounding errors (worst if only one year is chosen, then color legend is messed up, too)
## Updates for remote app in case new packages are used in the app:
* requirements.txt: Either manually or type 'pipreqs .' in the project directory (may first need to install pipreqs via 'pip install pipreqs')
* environment.yml: Manually
