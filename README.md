### Analyses
* PCA decomposition

## To Do
* Show Stropheninfo in tooltip for scatterplots
* Show numbers in correlation matrix heatmap
* Find a css style sheet
* Treemap: Let user chose if grouping by Country or different attribute (Baujahr etc.)
* Treemap: choice whether to include skits or not (currently not)

## Bugs
* x-filter = y-filter gives error
* Heatmap: Dauer/count colorscale is only refreshed when tab is changed

## Deployment process
* Update requirements.txt: type 'pipreqs .' in the project directory (may first need to install pipreqs via 'pip install pipreqs')
* Update environment.yml: Manually?
